This file provides information on source and applied transformations of the data

##Source of data
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Transformations
1. Reading source data which from training, test and subject files. In this step the script also imports features and activity labels which are required in later steps of transformation

2. Merging of test and train data is done by rbinding data sets with same column length

3. Cleaning the feature names is done by replacing lower-case labels and removing -() suffixes

4. The mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted

5. For improved readability activity codes are replaced with activity labels

6. Numbered variable names names for columns are replaced with actual variable names

7. Data from different sources is merged into final data set. Outputfile: complete_data.txt

8. To create summary data with verage of each variable for each activity and each subject an aggregation is performed. Outputfile: summary_data.txt
